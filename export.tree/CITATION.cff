abstract: >-
  This project will provide expertise for access,
  description, and modelling of the data collected in
  the individual projects as well as Z02 and Z03. INF
  will continuously assess general workflows,
  resource requirements, and data analysis processes
  to capture between-project differences that may
  impact data comparability and re-usability across
  projects. INF will provide tools, services and
  training to help projects align their research
  output to (i) facilitate data analysis for
  extracting common activity patterns and mechanisms
  underlying motor behaviours across species, and
  (ii) promote data-driven computational modelling.
